* Objectives for Thursday 28/08 [4/5]

- [X] Write the time averaging routine

- [X] Have a run for C_s=0.08 and average through time for t=5
  - This will be done after running the code with bamdads initial data
    for 1000 steps and then rerun the program.


- [X] Write the function that computes the statistical quantities.
  - Only the output left.

- [X] Write the preprocessing function.
     - I am evaluating it now


- [ ] Write the Dynamic Smagorinsky model

  

* Objectives for Wednesday 03/09 [5/8]
- [ ] compute the reynolds stresses and save the statistical data at another
  file  
  - [ ] I did not visualize the results though, action that i need to do and be 
    cautious with.
- From now on i ll save the statistical data into a different file called "statistical_data"

- [X] Compute u_tau at both walls
  - The time averaging will start when u_tau ~=1 at both walls
- [X] Convert the main code in order to start taking averages when u_tau ~=1 at
  both walls
- [X] Write a function that compares if mean_u is symmetric along the x_axis
  - When the profile is symmetric the code is converged

- [ ] These functions are written but not evaluated

- [X] Run a simulation with constant dt(0.001) for initial 

- [X] Check the dynamic smagorinsky function

- [ ] Read kim-moin  and deardorff paper

* Objectives for Friday 05/09 [2/8]
- [X] Run a simulation with flipped data along the x direction 2nd order lhs
- [X] Run a simulation with cfl=0.1 and 4th order lhs
- [ ] Write a document that describes the equations and the algorithm that my
  code follows.
- [ ] Check the values that are used to compute the Res* at the corrector stage.
- [ ] Check the process that i am doing when computing the auxilary fluxes
- [ ] Check how the implicit treatment of the viscous terms is being done
- [ ] Compute the energy spectra of the statistically averaged data
- [ ] Check why the static smagorinsky in not working
